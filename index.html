                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Hatshepsut was known as the <strong>first female pharaoh of Egypt</strong>. She reigned as pharaoh during the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, 
                    approximately from 1479 BCE to 1458 BCE. She <strong>broke gender barriers </strong>by assuming the full powers and title of a pharaoh.
                    <br>
                    She became pharaoh under unique circumstances. Initially, she was the queen consort to her husband, Pharaoh
                    Thutmose II. Upon his death, she began as regent to her stepson, Thutmose III, who was too young to rule. Over time,
                    <strong>Hatshepsut assumed the full powers and title of pharaoh</strong>, co-reigning with Thutmose III.

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Hatshepsut faced opposition during her rule, primarily due to the unconventional nature of a woman holding the
                    position of pharaoh. She had to navigate <strong>court which was not in favor of female rulers</strong>.
                    Despite this, she managed to maintain her authority and rule effectively for about two decades.
                    <br>
                    Her rule demonstrated that women could wield power effectively and maintain stability and prosperity in the
                    kingdom.
                    This paved the way for other female rulers, such as <strong>Cleopatra</strong>, who also became a prominent pharaoh in her
                    own right.
