                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hatshepsut was known as the <strong>first female pharaoh of Egypt</strong>. She reigned
                successfully for about 20 years, bringing a period of prosperity and peace to her kingdom. 
                Hatshepsut broke gender barriers by assuming the full powers and title of a pharaoh.
                <br>
                She became pharaoh under unique circumstances. Initially, she was the queen consort to her husband, Pharaoh
                Thutmose II. Upon his death, she began as regent to her stepson, Thutmose III, who was too young to rule. Over time,
                Hatshepsut assumed the full powers and title of pharaoh, co-reigning with Thutmose III.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p> Hatshepsut faced opposition during her rule, primarily due to the unconventional nature of a woman holding the position
                    of pharaoh. She had to navigate court politics and societal norms that were not in favor of female rulers. Despite this,
                    she managed to maintain her authority and rule effectively for about two decades. After her death, there were attempts
                    to erase her legacy, such as defacing her monuments, which suggests that some opposition continued even posthumously.
                    <br>
                    Her rule demonstrated that women could wield power effectively and maintain stability and prosperity in the kingdom.
                    This paved the way for other female rulers, such as Cleopatra VII, who also became a prominent pharaoh in her own right.
